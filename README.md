Senior check-in app is a web application designed to help families/caregivers stay connected with senior citizens through scheduled check-ins and alerts.

## Project: Senior Check-In System

"Making sure grandma's okay"

A simple system for checking in on elderly community members who live alone. The idea: seniors (or their families) sign up, and volunteers commit to regular check-ins — a phone call, a text, or even a visit. If a check-in is missed, someone gets notified.

Simplicity is everything here. Your users might not be tech-savvy, and that's okay. How do you make it dead simple for a 75-year-old to confirm "yes, I'm okay today"? How do you make sure volunteers actually follow through? And what happens when someone doesn't check in — who gets alerted, and how?

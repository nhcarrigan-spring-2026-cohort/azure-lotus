**Senior Check-in App**  
**Overview**

Senior Check-in is a web-based senior wellness check-in application that helps families coordinate daily wellness checks for elderly relatives living alone. The system connects three user types — family members, volunteers, and seniors — through scheduled check-ins, automated alerts, and a centralized dashboard.

**Problem Statement**  
Millions of elderly people live alone, and their family members often worry about their daily well-being. There is no simple, centralized system for families to coordinate regular wellness check-ins with trusted volunteers. Missed check-ins go unnoticed, emergencies are detected too late, and coordination between caregivers is disorganized.

**Solution**  
Our web app provides a simple platform where family members create profiles for their seniors, invite trusted volunteers, and set up daily check-in schedules. Volunteers see a real-time dashboard of who needs attention, and the system automatically detects missed check-ins and triggers alerts to all responsible parties.

**Target Users**

| Family Members(Adult children, relatives) | Managing Care remotely |
| :---- | :---- |
| Seniors(Elderly people living alone) | Simple way to confirm they’re Okay |
| Volunteers(Community Helpers, Neighbors, Friends) | Easy way to help  |

**Goals** 

* Enable families to set up wellness monitoring for seniors in under 10 minutes  
* Allow volunteers to identify seniors needing attention within 5 seconds of opening the dashboard  
* Detect missed check-ins and alert responsible parties within 30 minutes of deadline
